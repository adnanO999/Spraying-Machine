# Spraying-Machine
The project aims to apply simple kinematic principles such as motion transmition using belt, chain, gears, four bar linkage.
The design was built from scratch using solidworks passing through several modifications and enhancement process to accomplish the required task.
We took the project one step further and build a local website that hopefully will be deployed once ready. The aim of the website is to summarize the mechanism output and help the user getting parameters for the best opperation mode. For example the user will be provided with a suitable belt and sheaves to be used in order to maximize efficiency. Another useful feature is to check for the gear reduction ratio between the input and output to see if the plate is able to rotate and handle the object's weight to be painted

This project aims to enhance our understanding of kinematic principles in gears, chains, belts, linkages, etc. Therefore, we chose to implement an original mechanism that is not very popular online. Our spray-painter mechanism utilizes compound gear trains, chains, belts, worm gears, and bevel gears.

In this section we will be describing how the designed mechanism will perform its task and paint different objects that varies in shape and weight. We will be providing a description of each component and how it contributes to making our mechanism functional.
