# Spraying-Machine


This project aims to enhance our understanding of kinematic principles in gears, chains, belts, linkages, etc. Therefore, we chose to implement an original mechanism that is not very popular online. Our spray-painter mechanism utilizes compound gear trains, chains, belts, worm gears, and bevel gears.

Mechanism Description![pic3](https://github.com/adnanO999/Spraying-Machine/assets/88556508/49537edc-f05f-41af-83bd-ca2638512956)

In this section we will be describing how the designed mechanism will perform its task and paint different objects that varies in shape and weight. We will be providing a description of each component and how it contributes to making our mechanism functional.
